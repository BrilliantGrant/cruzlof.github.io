          	<h4>About Me</h4>
            <p>My name is Brilliant Kaimba from Kenya.Currently,I study in Moringa where we code.I choose programming because I enjoy developing and coding but most of all I want to build things that can make an impact.A lot of people want their work to have a wide impact. And becoming a developer provides you a platform to have a wide influence on society and attracts a lot of people to the profession.Although this is far off when i start off but it does motivate me.</p>
      			<p>We are affected by the society around us. Technology has been at the forefront in most of the spheres of our lives and this leads to my curiosity and interest generation towards the field among the school kids and young population today which then strengthens based on the other factors.Programming helps me work with others,Whatever role in a company, there’s a good chance I’ll have to work with programmers at some point. Having an understanding of programming languages helps me work together with them to solve problems and come up with fresh ideas.</p>
      			<p>The job prospects are great Coders, programmers and software engineers are in high demand, with more computing jobs available.In programmig,I’ll learn how to learn.This teaches me how to think logically and solve problems.
